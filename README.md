# Neural-Engine
Neural-Engine is a hardware accelerator for a single-neuron perceptron, designed using VLSI methodologies. It focuses on efficient MAC operations with enhanced testability by exposing intermediate results via the I/O interface. This repository supports both the VLSI design and FPGA testing teams.
